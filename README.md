# 🚨 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Machine Learning–based **Network Intrusion Detection System** designed to analyze network traffic and detect malicious activities with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical application of cybersecurity concepts combined with data-driven machine learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview

With the rapid growth of network-based applications, detecting unauthorized and malicious activities has become critical. Traditional rule-based security systems often fail to detect new and evolving attack patterns.
This project addresses that gap by implementing an **intelligent intrusion detection system** that learns from historical network traffic data and identifies suspicious behavior effectively.
